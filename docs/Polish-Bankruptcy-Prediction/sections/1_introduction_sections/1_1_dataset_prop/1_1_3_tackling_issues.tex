\subsection{Tackling Issues}\label{ssec:tackleissues}
As described in the previous Subsections \ref{ssec:feat_exp} and \ref{ssec:data_imb}, it was found that when analysing the properties of the dataset. So, to recap the issue of having missing values in the dataset will be tackled by using Mean and Mode imputation as described in Subsection \ref{sssec:imputetech}. These imputation techniques will also be applied for comparative reasons. As for data imbalance, SMOTE technique will be used to oversample the dataset for each forecasting period/year as described in Subsection \ref{sssec:smote}. Furthermore, other techniques will also be applied to experiment with the feature set, but these techniques will be described later on.
