\subsection{Chi2 Feature Selection}\label{ssec:chisquared}
The Chi2 test \cite{jin2006machine} is used to determine if the feature/s and outcome are dependent or not. It is important that the features and classes do not contain non-negative values (re-scaling can be used to change negative values to positive values, by changing the range of the values as described in Subsection \ref{ssec:normalisation}). It is often used in Machine Learning to rank features based on their Chi2 statistic (score). Features which are not found to be dependent on the outcome (irrelevant for classification), are discarded depending on a specified number of features to be selected, so that only the top ranked features are selected.
