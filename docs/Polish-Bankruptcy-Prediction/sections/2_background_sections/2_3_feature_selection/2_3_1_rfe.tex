\subsection{Recursive Feature Elimination}\label{ssec:rfe}
The Recursive Feature Elimination \cite{guyon2002gene}, as the name suggests, recursively fits the model and eliminates the least important feature/s with every iteration. This is done by ranking the features according to their coefficient weight and eliminating the least weighted feature/s, depending if the algorithm is set to eliminate 1 or more feature with every iteration. After each iteration the model is fitted again, and the least weighted feature/s are eliminated again, until the specified number of maximum iterations or features to be eliminated is reached. In this project, this will be used with the Logistic Regression classifier.
