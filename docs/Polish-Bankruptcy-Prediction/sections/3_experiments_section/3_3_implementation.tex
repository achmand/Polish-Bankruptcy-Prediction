\section{Implementation of Machine Learning Techniques}\label{sec:implmltech}
All implementations described below were initialized in the Jupyter Notebook and validated during each experiment. Every implementation uses \textbf{numpy} \cite{python:numpy} library for arrays and this was done to get better performance. Below each implementation is desrcibed in further detail.
