\noindent All the scripts written for this project can be found in \textit{'src/'} path. The code is well commented and can be easily followed. The main file for this project is the Jupyter Notebook called \textbf{bankruptcy\_predictions.ipynb} which utilizes the scripts written for this project. The Notebook is also found in the \textit{'src/'}, together with the anaconda environment used in the project which is saved as a \textit{'.yaml'} file. Everything is publicly available on the following  \MYhref{https://github.com/achmand/Polish-Bankruptcy-Prediction}{GitHub Repository}: https://github.com/achmand/Polish-Bankruptcy-Prediction. 

\noindent The dataset chosen for this project is about bankrupt Polish companies \cite{PDS:2016} that were analysed between 2000 and 2012, while the non-bankrupt companies were investigated between 2007 to 2013. The data was acquired from EMIS \cite{EMIS:2019} which is a service that offers information on emerging markets. Furthermore, this dataset will be used to classify and predict whether Polish companies will go bankrupt or not.
